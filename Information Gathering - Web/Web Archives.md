# Why Wayback Matters for Web Reconnaissance
- uncover hidden assets and vulnerabilities
    
    - discover old webpages, directories, files, or subdomains that may not be accessible currently
    
- tracking changes and identifying patterns
    
    - obesrve how the website has evolved, revealing changes in structure, content, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities
    
- gathering intelligence
    
    - archived content can be a valuable source of OSINT
    
    - insight into target’s past activities, marketing strategies, employees, and technology choices
    
- stealthy reconnaissance
    
    - accessing archived snapshots is a passive activity that doesn’t directly interact with the targets infrastructure
