# Lateral Movement, Pivoting, and Tunneling Compared
## Lateral Movement
- used to further our access to addtional hosts, applications, or services
    
    - gaining credentials and reusing them somewhere else
    
  
## Pivoting
- utilizing multiple hosts to cross network boundaries
  
## Tunneling
- using HTTP to mask our C2 traffic from a server we own to the victim host
    
    - key is obfuscation
